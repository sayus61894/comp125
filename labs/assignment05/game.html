My minions have told me that he is a slippery little fella, he teleports around. After he dies, he is almost immediately reincarnated. To make matters worse, he after reincarnating he teleports around even quicker! I am sorry to say you may never beat him, but know that you will go down as the greatest General in my army once I have conquered the Human Realm.</p></div>
